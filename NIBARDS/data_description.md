# Data description

## Labels
At the tissue sample scale, our problem is a supervised one as we have mutation data over the whole training set. Labels for the train dataset are in train_output.csv​ (0=​wildtype and 1=mutated​). At the tile scale, the problem is a weakly supervised one as we have one label per bag of tiles.

## Inputs
For each patient, we provided three types of input:

* the set of (maximum 1,000) tile images randomly chosen inside the tissue as .jpg files

* the feature vectors extracted from each of the tiles using a pre-trained resnet model

* metadata related to the original slide image.



## Images
In the image folder (images) is stored one folder per sample, named sample_id containing RGB images of size 224x224x3 (i.e. 3D matrices) stored as .jpg files with the following names:

`[sample_id]_tile_[tile_id]_[zoom_level]_[x_coord]_[y_coord].jpg`

Each folder contains (up to) 1,000 tiles. The whole-slide images used in this challenge originally come from the TCGA-BRCA dataset.

## MoCo v2 features
In the feature folder (moco_features) is stored one matrix per sample named [sample_id].npy. This matrix is of size Nₜ x 2,051 with Nₜ the number of tiles for the given sample. The first column is the zoom level, the second and third are coordinates of the tile in the slide. The last 2048 columns are the actual MoCo features.

> Each matrix has 1,000 rows (one for each tile of corresponding image folder).

The MoCo v2 features have been extracted using a Wide ResNet-50-2 pre-trained on TCGA-COAD. We decided to extract these features to help people who do not have the computing resources or time to train directly from images.

## Metadata
Additionally, available metadata are provided as csv files (train_metadata.csv and test_metadata.csv), that contain the following columns: "Sample ID", "Center ID" that indicates the hospital of origin and "Patient ID", the unique identifier of patients, as some patients may have several slides.

## Outputs
Outputs must be float numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 which represent the probability of PIK3CA mutation. The train output file train_output.csv simply consists of two columns separated by commas denominated "Sample ID" and "Target" in the first line (header), where "Sample ID" refers to the unique identifier of the sample and "Target" indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of PIK3CA mutation. Patient IDs are sorted by increasing sample ID.

# Note on heterogeneity
We would like to highlight two things:

* 73 patients is a really small test set and therefore variability between the two test sets can be expected, especially if you are overfitting the first test set by using a lot of submissions. However, the small size of our datasets is a real life problem that we have to deal with and being able to overcome this barrier is a crucial point.

* A second very important source of poor transfer is the disparity between centers. Indeed, data originates from 5 different centers. The training set comprises data from 3 centers, while the test set contains data from the 2 remaining ones. It would be wise to take this source of heterogeneity into account.

# Metric
The metric for the challenge is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and is computed as follows:
